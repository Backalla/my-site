This article is one of the series of articles on neural networks.
 - Neural Networks intro (this article)
 - Loss function
 - Activation function

So you have started with Machine Learning and went through pretty much every short tutorial on how everything works and what to do to get started. But still, there might be a gap in your understanding of the exact mechanism of how neural networks internally work.

You must have come across some of the words like Backpropagation, Regularization, Activation Function, etc. But never really understood the math behind these. Itâ€™s a lot easier to code your own neural network when you can visualize the underlying processes and how things flow through the network.
